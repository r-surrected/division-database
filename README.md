# The Division Database

This will be quite the yap so here's a shortened version:

I wanted to be able to track changes in divisions, so I made a website that does that.

Longer version here:

I've been in the City-17 community on and off since 2020 and I have always wanted something to track the changes in all of the divisions. It would always be "this person left" or "this person joined", but how do you track all that? It became a little annoying to do this.
I made this project to solve this problem. It tracks all divisional and OTA changes so that you don't have to. 

Right now I'm working on automatically updating it. Currently the username change system is breaking, so any changes just break.
